# Mental-Maths-Game

A platformer-style game intended to assist students in secondary school with developing their mental maths skills. Drive your bike or car through the levels, collecting all the coins as you go along and answering all the questions as quick as you can. Chose an appropriate difficulty for questions, rank up in the leaderboard and see if you can improve your statistics. 

An A Level project that was developed over the course of 6 months completely from scratch. Built using Python and the pygame engine and Tiled with pytmx to create and run the graphical maps. Simple management of the questions using the "question.csv" spreadsheet, and has permanent storage of the leaderboard and statistics data using pickle object structures.

## Documentation

The **248 page**, **90,000 word** documentation can be found here 👉 [Krishan-Sritharar-Computer-Science-Coursework](../main/Krishan-Sritharar-Computer-Science-Coursework.pdf)
